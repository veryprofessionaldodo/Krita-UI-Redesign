# Krita UI Redesign Plugin

A plugin made to modernize the UI of Krita based on community feedback.

Currently contains the removal of the white line in toolbars, done by [Kapyia](https://github.com/Kapyia).

To install, download this repo and unzip it to Krita's *pykrita* folder:
+ Linux user will find this folder at `~/.local/share/krita/pykrita/`.
+ Windows users till find this folder at `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\krita\pykrita`.

Make sure the '.desktop' file is in the main folder of the `pykrita` folder!

Alternatively, this folder can be found by opening Krita and clicking `Settings -> Manage Resources -> Open Resource Folder... -> pykrita`.

After installing it, you need to enable the plugin itself. Go to `Settings -> Configure Krita -> Python Plugin Manager` and enable it. After that, just restart Krita, and you can check the features you want on the "Redesign" tab on the menu!
